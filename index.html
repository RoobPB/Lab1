  <h1>Manifesto for Agile Software Development</h1>
<p>We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:</p>
<p><strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools<br>
<strong>Working software</strong> over comprehensive documentation<br>
<strong>Customer collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation<br>
<strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan</p>
<br><br><br>

<div id="First">
<ul> <strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools:</ul>
   <li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
  through early and continuous delivery
  of valuable software. <br><br></li>
  <li>Build projects around motivated individuals.
  Give them the environment and support they need,
  and trust them to get the job done.</li>
  <li>The most efficient and effective method of
  conveying information to and within a development
  team is face-to-face conversation</li>
  <li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs
  emerge from self-organizing teams.</li>
  </div><br>

<div id="Second">
  <ul> <strong>Working software</strong> over comprehensive documentation</ul>
  <li>Business people and developers must work
  together daily throughout the project.</li>
  <li>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</li>
  <li>Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
  of work not done--is essential.</li><br>
  
</div>
<div id="Third">
  <ul><strong>Customer collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation<br></ul>
  <li>Deliver working software frequently, from a
  couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
  preference to the shorter timescale.</li>
  <li>Business people and developers must work
  together daily throughout the project.</li>
  <li>Build projects around motivated individuals.
  Give them the environment and support they need,
  and trust them to get the job done.</li><br>
  
  
</div>
<div id="Fourth">
  <ul><strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan</ul>
  <li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.</li>
  <li>Agile processes promote sustainable development.
  The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
  to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</li>
  <li>Continuous attention to technical excellence
  and good design enhances agility.</li>
  <li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
  to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
  its behavior accordingly.
</li>
